Requirements

  1. When a user loads the home page, they should be redirected to a page that
  lists all of the users' names. Load the users from the users.yaml file
  (content below).

  2. Each of the users' names should be a link to a page for that user.

  3. On each user's page, display their email address. Also display their
  interests, with a comma appearing between each interest.

  4. At the bottom of each user's page, list links to all of the other users
  pages. Do not include the user whose page it is in this list.

  4. Add a layout to the application. At the bottom of every page, display a
  message like this: "There are 3 users with a total of 9 interests."

  5. Update the message printed out in #5 to determine the number of users and
  interests based on the content of the YAML file. Use a helper method,
  count_interests, to determine the total number of interests across all users.

  6. Add a new user to the users.yaml file. Verify that the site updates
  accordingly.
